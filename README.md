This repo contains my Connects from over the years.

## How to use

In the `connects` folder, there is a `TEMPLATE-Connect-YYYY-MM.md` file which, obviously, acts as a template for future connects. Simply:

* copy this file to a file with the current month like: `Connect-2021-05.md`
* Then open that file and replace all of the Markdown comments (`<!-- -->`) with your responses
* When you need to submit your Connect, just copy the responses into the online form
